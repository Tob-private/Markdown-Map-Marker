To the west of the Crater lies the famous Ghaba, a thick forest of trees that never shed their leaves, populated by animals and magical creatures alike, as well as housing some druidic conclaves and several kingdoms of xenophobic elves scattered across the area. Mothers from the city say never to enter these woods alone, as it is almost certain you will get lost in the masses of trees, bushes and undergrowth.
